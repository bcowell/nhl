# Notes
The client was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
3rd party [nhl API docs](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/blob/master/stats-api.md) 


# Ideas
Tables/stats view of players/teams/positions for the nhl

/           - landing a nice table view of the current east/west team rankings
/teams      -
